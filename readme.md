# MERN Project

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project. It consists of two main directories: `server` and `client`.

## Server

The `server` directory contains the backend code built with Node.js and Express.js. It handles the business logic, interacts with the database, and serves API endpoints to the client.

### Setup

1. Navigate to the `server` directory: `cd server`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables as needed (e.g., MongoDB connection string, JWT secret)
4. Start the server: `npm start`

## Client

The `client` directory contains the frontend code built with React.js. It provides the user interface and interacts with the backend server to fetch and display data.

### Setup

1. Navigate to the `client` directory: `cd client`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables if required (e.g., API base URL)
4. Start the client: `npm start`

## Deployment

For deploying the project, you may choose to deploy the server and client separately or together as a unified application, depending on your requirements and hosting environment.
